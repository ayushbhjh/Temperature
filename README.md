# Temperature

### Temperature Converter

This simple web application allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The interface is user-friendly and intuitive, providing a hassle-free experience.

#### Usage

1. Enter the temperature value in any of the input fields for Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
2. The other two input fields will automatically update to show the converted values.
3. Use the "All clear" button to reset all input fields.

#### Features

- **Input Fields:** Easily identifiable input fields for each temperature unit.
- **Real-Time Conversion:** Instantaneous conversion as you type values.
- **All Clear Button:** Quickly reset all input fields to start fresh.

#### Instructions for Implementation

1. **HTML Structure:** The HTML file contains the necessary structure for the temperature converter application. It includes input fields for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin along with the required JavaScript file.

2. **CSS Styling:** The CSS file (`temp.css`) styles the application, providing an attractive and responsive layout. It ensures proper alignment and enhances the visual experience.

3. **JavaScript Logic:** The JavaScript file (`temp.js`) contains the logic for temperature conversion. Event listeners on input fields update the other fields in real-time. The "All clear" button clears all input fields when clicked.

#### Code Structure

The code is organized into three main sections:

1. **HTML:** Defines the structure of the web application, including input fields and references to necessary stylesheets and scripts.

2. **CSS:** Provides styling to ensure a visually appealing and responsive layout for the temperature converter.

3. **JavaScript:** Contains the logic for temperature conversion and event handling to update values dynamically.
